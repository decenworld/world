# Multiplayer Browser Game with WebSocket

This is a multiplayer browser-based game using Phaser and WebSockets for real-time communication.

## Deployment Guide

### Important Note About WebSockets on Netlify

Netlify Functions are serverless functions that run in a stateless environment. They don't support long-lived connections like WebSockets natively. For a multiplayer game, you need to deploy a separate WebSocket server.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy the WebSocket Server**:
   
   The `server.js` file contains the WebSocket server implementation. Deploy this to a service that supports long-running processes, such as:
   
   - Heroku
   - Railway
   - Render
   - DigitalOcean
   - AWS EC2

   Example deployment on Heroku:
   ```bash
   # Install Heroku CLI if you haven't already
   npm install -g heroku

   # Login to Heroku
   heroku login

   # Create a new Heroku app
   heroku create

   # Deploy to Heroku
   git push heroku main
   ```
   
   **Railway Deployment Instructions:**
   
   1. Sign up for a Railway account at [railway.app](https://railway.app/)
   
   2. Install the Railway CLI:
      ```bash
      npm i -g @railway/cli
      ```
   
   3. Login to Railway from your terminal:
      ```bash
      railway login
      ```
   
   4. Initialize a new Railway project in your repository:
      ```bash
      railway init
      ```
   
   5. Create a new service for your WebSocket server:
      ```bash
      railway add
      ```
      
      Select "Empty Service" when prompted for a template.
   
   6. Deploy your WebSocket server:
      ```bash
      railway up
      ```
   
   7. Get your service URL:
      ```bash
      railway domain
      ```
      
      This will give you the URL to your deployed service. Note that Railway automatically assigns HTTPS, so your WebSocket URL will start with `wss://`.
   
   8. You can also deploy by connecting your GitHub repository:
      - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app/) dashboard
      - Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
      - Select your repository and branch
      - Railway will automatically deploy your server
   
   9. Configure environment variables (if needed):
      - Go to your project in the Railway dashboard
      - Click on your service
      - Click on the "Variables" tab
      - Add any environment variables your app needs
      
      **Required Environment Variable for Cloudflare Turnstile:**
      - `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Cloudflare Turnstile secret key

2. **Update WebSocket Connection URL**:
   
   In `public/js/game.js`, update the WebSocket connection URL to point to your deployed server:
   
   ```javascript
   // Change this line in connectWebSocket function:
   wsUrl = 'wss://your-project-name.railway.app'; // Update with your Railway app URL
   ```

3. **Deploy the Frontend to Netlify**:
   
   - Create a Netlify account if you don't have one
   - Connect your repository to Netlify
   - Set the build command (if needed) and publish directory to `public`
   - Deploy the site

## Cloudflare Turnstile Integration

This game uses Cloudflare Turnstile to protect the login screen with a CAPTCHA. To configure:

1. The site key `0x4AAAAAABCEsgftQ0R1Rv3F` is already set in the frontend code.

2. Set up your secret key:
   - Set the `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable on your Railway deployment
   - This key is used by the server to verify CAPTCHA responses

3. If you need to use your own Turnstile keys:
   - Register at [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/)
   - Create a new site and get your site key and secret key
   - Update the site key in `game.js` in the `showLoginScreen()` function
   - Update the secret key in your Railway environment variables

## Local Development

To run the game locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the WebSocket server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## Game Controls

- WASD or arrow keys to move
- Click to shoot
- Mobile controls will appear automatically on touch devices

## Troubleshooting

- If WebSocket connections are failing, check:
  - CORS settings on your WebSocket server
  - SSL/TLS certificates (wss:// requires valid SSL)
  - Network/firewall restrictions

- Common errors:
  - "Cannot set properties of null" - Usually related to WebSocket initialization
  - "WebSocket connection failed" - Check the server URL and ensure the server is running
